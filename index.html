				<h2>Kuiper?</h2>
				<div class="section-inner">
					<p>
						Kuiper (rhymes with hyper) is named after the
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">Kuiper belt</a>,
						the astroid belt that contains Pluto. Her birthday is ?? April,
						2021.
					</p>
					<p>
						She's an easy-going, loving little girl who will show affection to
						anyone who plays with her. She can be a bit shy/reserved at first,
						but once she comes out of her shell, she shows just how much of a
						little goofball she is.

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The autofeeder keeps her from waking you up for food, but she will
							meow and meow when it's dinner time. I try to feed her at the same
							time every day. If she's hungry before dinnertime & starts
							begging, I remind her that she has dry food to eat.
						</li>
						<li>
							Every once in a while she throws up from eating dinner too
							quickly. It's rare, but if it happens, I give her dinner in two
							batches, spaced out 30 minutes.
						</li>

				<h2>Behavior</h2>
				<div class="section-inner">
					<h3>Approaching</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							She is very wary of people trying to pick/snatch her up, so I
							usually advice folks to have one hand behind their back when they
							go to meet her.
						</li>
						<li>
							In the beginning, she prefers just a finger or two, but quickly
							gets adjusted to a fuller petting experience.
						</li>
						<li>
							Leaning over her or carrying items above her may make her dart.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Litter</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I have supplied a mat along with an enclosed litterbox. The box
							has four snaps that come undone to allow easier access to the
							inside for scooping.
						</li>
						<li>
							Along with the litterbox, I have a LitterChamp device for easy
							litter removal. Simply use your foot or knee to open it and scoop
							the litter in. It contains the smell and can hold quite a bit
							(I've never timed it out, but I'd guess at least a week or two).
							There are extra bags in a small box.
